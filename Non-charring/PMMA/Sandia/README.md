### Experimental Conditions: TGA, DSC
A Netzsch F3 Jupiter using a DSC sample carrier with S-type thermocouples, and a Silicon Carbide furnace was used to conduct Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (TGA + DSC) experiments. Although tests were conducted simultaneously, TGA and DSC measurement data presented here are separated into two files, for consistency with other datasets.

* Heating Rate: 1, 10, or 50 K/min
* Temperature program
  - Initial temperature 303.15 K
  - Isotherm: 20 minutes
  - Maximum Temperature 873.15 K
* Sample mass: 2-6 mg
* Sample geometry: powdered
* Calibration type: The instrument is calibrated at least once per 6 months, or sooner (as needed), using melting point standards for both temperature and DSC sensitivity.  The calibration standards used are In, Sn, Bi, Zn, Al, Ag, Au, and Ni.

* Crucible type: 85 ï¿½L, Al2O3 crucibles (no lids)
* Carrier Gas
  - ultra-high-purity argon  (0% O2)
  - Flow rate = 100  ml/min
