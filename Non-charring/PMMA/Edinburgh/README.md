### Experimental Conditions: Cone Calorimeter
Standard cone calorimeter and tests were carried out on 100 x 100 x 6 mm slabs of cast black PMMA. Standard cone calorimeter sample holders were used to expose a 95 x 95 mm face of the material to the heating element. A Schmidt-Boelter heat flux gauge was used to calibrate the conical heater to within 1% of the desired heat flux.

The sample was wrapped with 1 layer of aluminum foil to contain the melting of the PMMA slab over the course of the experiment. The foil was in contact with an aluminum block 10 mm thick with a hole milled for a 1 mm K-type thermocouple. The thermocouple was located 5 mm from the surface that was in contact with the foil. The remaining sample holder depth was filled with ceramic paper.

Before each trial the sample mass was recorded. The sample was observed to be entirely consumed in all of the experiments. The thermocouple wire leading from the sample holder was ran between the opening of the glass doors of the cone calorimeter so that the doors could remain closed. Some slack was provided in the cable to mitigate tension on the sample, however the mass readings may have been influenced by the presence of the thermocouple wire. The reported mass includes the mass of the sample holder, aluminum block, and backing insulation.

Difference between total mass lost and reported initial sample mass is generally within 5-10%; the highest difference observed was approximately 10 g. The difference in recorded mass loss and initial sample mass may be a result of the thermocouple wire interfering with load cell measurements.

NOTE: Sample Holder Mass was not tared prior to testing, thus initial mass could be >1000g. All cone data was 'tared' such that the initial mass, m0_exp, was determined (5s average when readings were first steady) and the difference (m_diff = m0_exp - m0) between this value and the reported initial mass of the sample (m0) was calculated. ALL reported mass values where then reduced by m_diff.
