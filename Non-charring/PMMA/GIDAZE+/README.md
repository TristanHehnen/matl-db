GIHAZE+ is made of three groups working together: Imperial College London, Universidad de Cantabria and Reax Engineering.

### Experimental Conditions: TGA, DSC
A Netzsch F3 Jupiter was used to conduct Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (TGA + DSC) experiments. Although tests were conducted simultaneously, TGA and DSC measurement data presented here are separated into two files, for consistency with other datasets.
Note: DSC heat flow data was rescaled (multiplied by -1)such that endothermic heat flow events are positive (endo up)
