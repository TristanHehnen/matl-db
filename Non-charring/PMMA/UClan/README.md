### Experimental Conditions: Cone Calorimeter
Note: Cone HRR data was provided as HRR [kW] as originally requested. This dataset was then scaled to provide [kW/m2] assuming a sample surface area of 0.0088m2 (standard for cone calorimeter tests with a sample holder cover).
Additionally, back surface temperature measurements were originally output at 2Hz, they have been linearly interpolated here to provide estimates of Temperature at 1Hz.

Sample holder: steel frame 10 x 10 cm.

  - Shape: square [?]
  - Diameter or edge length: 0.1 m [?]
  - Exposed surface area (nominal): 0.0088 m² [?]
  - Thickness: None m [?]
  - Note: Cone HRR data was provided as HRR [kW] as originally requested. This dataset was then scaled to provide [kW/m2] assuming a sample surface area of 0.0088m2 (standard for cone calorimeter tests with a sample holder cover).
* Sample holder
  - Shape: square [?]
