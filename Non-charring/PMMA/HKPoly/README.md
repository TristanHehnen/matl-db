### Experimental Conditions: TGA, DSC
A TA Instruments SDT Q600 (V20.9 Build 20) was used to conduct Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (TGA + DSC) experiments. STA experiments performed in Nitrogen and in Air. Although tests were conducted simultaneously, TGA and DSC measurement data presented here are separated into two files, for consistency with other datasets.
